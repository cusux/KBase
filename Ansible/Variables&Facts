Variable scopes:
- Global    (accessible across plays in a playbook)
- Play  (inside a play)
- Host  (each host has it's own)

Registered with: register
Referenced with: {{ varname }}
Python lists and dictionaries are available => my.var  OR   my['var']

Variables can be applied at any level:
- Playbook, before tasks block using "vars" block
- Role, in roles/rolename/vars directory using playbook structure
- Group in inventory file
- Host in inventory file
- Command line using "--extra-vars" for "ansible-playbook"
- Use "global_vars/all" file inside playblook structure
- Include using, "include_vars: myvars.yml"

Reserved variable names:
- hostvars:           access variables and facts from other hosts
- group_names:        a list of the groups that the current host is in
- groups:             all groups (and all hostnames) in the inventory
- inventory_hostname: the cirrent hostname that Ansible is executing tasks on
- environment:        advanced Ansible environment details

Variable precedence:
- Role defaults
- Inventory vars
- Inventory group_vars
- Inventory host_vars
- Playbook group_vars
- Playbook host_vars
- Host facts
- Play vars
- Play vars_prompt
- Play vars_files
- Registered vars
- Set_facts
- Role and include vars
- Block vars (only for tasks in block)
- Task vars (only for the task)

Facts: information about hosts in your inventory that is gathered by Ansible when it connects
- Facts are stored in a dictionary.
- Facts gathering can be disabled in the playbook using, "gather_facts: False"
- Gather facts an print it to stdout: "ansible <host> -m setup -u root"
- Acces facts with {{ hostvars[host]['fact_name'] }}
