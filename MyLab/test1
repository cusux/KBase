1)  Root password is lost, make sure you gain access to the system.

2)  Configure hostname with: su02-srvr1.lab1.com
    Configure NIC with IP: 192.168.10.20/24, Gateway: 192.168.10.1, DNS: 192.168.10.200.

3)  Set default boot target to multiuser.

6)  Activate and start firewalld.

7)  Set primary prompt for user root to display the hostname, username and current working directory.

8)  Create users barry, harry, larry, mary, gary with home directories and password "password".
    Accounts for mary and barry should expire on 31-12-2017.
    Accounts for larry and gary should have secondary group to "dba" (create it if not existing).

9)  Create directory "testdir" in mary's homedir as mary.
    Set ACL on it so barry has read and write access.

10) Setup a yum repository with origin located at "ftp://su01-ipa.lab1.com/pub/rhel7".

11) Create a logical volume called "linuxadmin" with the size of 10 LogicalExtends in volume group "vgtest" (create vgtest with 32MB PE size).
    Create a mount point at /mnt/linuxadmin and mount the volume.
    Make the mount persistent after reboot.

12) Add group called linuxadmin and change group ownership of "/mnt/linuxadmin" to linuxadmin.

13) Extend linuxadmin filesystem in vgtest with 35MB.

14) Create a swap partition of 65MB on available disk.
    Use UUID to make persistent after reboot.

15) Create a standard partition of 60MB on available disk and format it with ext4.
    Mount it on /mnt/test1.
    Use UUID to make persistent after reboot.

16) Create a directory /extra_root and apply SELinux context of /root on it.

17) Set up a cron job as user mary to run every Monday on 01:20 AM.
    It takes the timestamp of that moment and appends it to a file "cronstamp" in mary's homedir.

18) Use bzip2 to create a compressed archive of /usr/local directory and store it in /root/testarchive.
